Nyan Cat, sadly, is no longer a part of MTG. I don't really know if this	
mod even works any more. Feel free to use it, however :)	

This mod adds Nyan Cat's evil twin, Tac Nayn. Tac Nayn is a black cat.	
Instead of poptarts, Tac Nayn has waffles. It's "rainbow" is grayscale.		
Tac Nayn generates the same way as a Nyan Cat. If the waffles mod is enabled,	
you can craft Tac Nayn and it's rainbows.	

**Mod Contains:**	
*	Tac Nayn	
*	Tac Nayn Rainbow	

**Crafting (only applies if the waffle mod is enabled):**	

*	Tac Nayn:	
B = Black Dye   W = Large Waffle   N = Nyan Cat		
|B||W||B|	
|W||N||W|	
|B||W||B|	

*	Tac Nayn Rainbow	
B = Black Dye   D = Dark Grey Dye   G = Grey Dye   R = Nyan Cat Rainbow			
|B||D||G|	
|D||R||D|	
|G||D||B|	
(reverse works as well)
