Farming Redo mod for Minetest
=============================

Information
-----------

This mod replaces the default `farming` mod with a fully compatible API that allows
players to grow crops even when they are not nearby.  It also includes many new foods
and crops which can be planted directly onto tilled soil without seeds.  Crops that do
require seeds like wheat and cotton are found when digging in long grasses, and will
require player to stay nearby until they germinate before growing normally.

Tech information
----------------

Crops grow by adding your new plant to the {growing = 1} group and numbering the stages from _1 to as many stages as you like, but the underscore MUST be used only once in the node name to separate plant from stage number e.g.

* "farming:cotton_1"      through to   "farming:cotton_8"
* "farming:wheat_1"       through to   "farming:wheat_8"
* "farming:cucumber_1"    through to   "farming:cucumber_4"

Farming Redo also works with Bonemeal mod for quick growing crops and saplings which can
be found at https://notabug.org/TenPlus1/bonemeal

#### Optional dependences:

* default
* mcl_core, mcl_sounds, mcl_farming, mcl_stairs
* stairs
* lucky_block (adds 47 lucky blocks)
* toolranks

#### Configuration

`farming.conf` is used to load custom settings for each crop and can be found in either the
farming mod folder or the world folder.  Also `minetest.conf` contains a setting for crop growth speed.
