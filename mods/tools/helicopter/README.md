Minetest 5.4 mod: Not So Simple Helicopter
========================================

This is the "Not So Simple Helicopter", fork of the old "Simple Helicopter".
This version is more expensive to produce and that uses biofuel from crops. So far we have a helicopter that consumes fuel, has its consumption changed according to the level of flight. It dependes on a second mod (based on the wine mod), with a distiller that allows to transform some inputs into biofuel and fly with them.
A passenger can go onboard when the pilot is inside
Now the direction is controlled by A and D keys, but if you want do change direction by mouse, just type E key to change the flight dynamics and A and D just tilt the helicopter to sides again

It can be painted using dye of any color you want, you must punch the seat with the dye.
