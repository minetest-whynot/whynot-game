1. In what ways might this mod take over the game?
  - 
2. When could this mod be a strain on the server when no players are using the mod?
  - 
3. When does this mod destroy player's work?
  - 
4. Have you looked at the code? If so, what stood out as things that might need fixing?
  - 
5. In what way might this mod be reduced to be more simple (as in "Keep it Simple Stupid") (ex: "the foobar mod could be made more simple by splitting into two mods, foo and bar")
  - 
6. Is this mod survival freindly? What items that it provides that _should_ be craftable/obtainable, but arent?
  - 
7. When does this mod feel like cheating?
  - 
8. Does this mod use the software "git" for version control? (note: we are asking about git. Github, Gitlab, notabug and hundreds of other git _providers_ exist but are not specificly needed, although these do qualify).
